{"name":"Adventurer's Amulets","tagline":"Why have Diamonds when you could have a belt?","body":"### What is Adventurer's Amulets?\r\nAdventurer's Amulets is a mod for Minecraft. It uses @Azanor's Baubles API to add extra trinkets and amulets to the game that can be used to defend you, attack others or for utility purposes. On this page, you will find all the information you will need on how to use the mod.\r\n\r\n### CurseForge\r\nThis mod will be able to download from CurseForge as soon as it is ready to be fully released to the public. Keep an eye out for when it will be released.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Items\r\n## Pendants\r\nPendants are used for defense. They will passively protect you from a type of damage, based on their type. For example, the Windmaker's Pendant will protect you from all fall damage, whilst the Infernal Pendant will protect you from any Fire Damage. An extra layer of defense will also be available, and can be toggled on or off via a key-bind (set your controls menu).\r\n\r\n## Belts\r\nBelts will assist the user passively. The belts will all allow you to get from A to B much easier, in a variety of different ways. As an example, the Windmaker's Belt allows you to walk much faster and the Transposing Belt allows you to teleport around the world at speed. By pressing the key-bind, you will gain access to another utility feature such as access to your Ender Chest or the ability to place lights if it gets too dark.\r\n\r\n## Rings\r\nIn Baubles, you have two ring slots, this means that you can choose from a variety of different combinations. As a general rule, rings are there to assist you through abilities such as Flight, but can also be used as an offensive weapon.\r\n\r\n### Charge\r\n## What is charge?\r\nCharge is the way that all of your Baubles are powered within Adventurer's Amulets. Each set of Baubles is powered in a different way, as detailed below.\r\n\r\n# Windmaker's\r\nAll Windmaker's items will gain charge if you are standing above Y-level 200. They do so at a pretty fast rate, so building your home in the skies might not be a bad idea.\r\n\r\n# Infernal\r\nAll Infernal items will gain charge if you are in a hot place. If you are burning, they will gain charge (fire resistance potions work). Alternatively, just being in the Nether will gain you all the charge you will need. If you are a pyromaniac, you might want to settle in the Nether.\r\n\r\n# Aquatic\r\nAll Aquatic items will gain charge from being in the water. If you just stand in 1 block of water or more, your items will start to gain charge. If you can control the tides, the ocean will become your home.\r\n\r\n# Floral\r\nAll Floral items will gain charge whilst you are in direct sunlight. If it is sunny outside, and there are no blocks between you and the sky, you will start to gain charge. Let the rays of the sun beam down on you, and nature will become your shelter.\r\n\r\n# Transposing\r\nAll Transposing items will gain charge whilst you are in the End. No matter where you are in the End, you will gain charge. If you don't look at the Endermen, they won't hurt you and the End will be your beginning.\r\n\r\n## Focus Crystals\r\nYou can't always be in the right place at the right time, and that's where Focus Crystals come in! Just like the Baubles, if you have them in your inventory they will charge, but they will also charge your Baubles for you. Take your floral items into the depths of hell? Go right ahead.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any queries, e-mail me on gustoniaeagle@gmail.com, message me on Twitter or send me a message on GitHub.
