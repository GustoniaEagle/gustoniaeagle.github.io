{"name":"Eagle's Nest","tagline":"This the website for all my projects, take a look around!","body":"### Welcome to Eagle's Nest!\r\nHi! My name is GustoniaEagle, but Eagle will do. I am a mod developer for Minecraft, using the Forge API. I am currently working on the [Adventurer's Amulets](http://gustoniaeagle.github.io/Adventurers-Amulets/) mod, and am hoping for a release in the very close future. To keep up with the updates, either follow me on GitHub, or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GustoniaEagle).\r\n\r\n### GustoCraft\r\nGustoCraft is a modded server, ran by myself for invited members of the community. You may see my live stream things from the server on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/gustoniaeagle). You may even get a sneak peak at upcoming features.\r\n\r\n### OpenSource\r\nAll of my code is open source, and that is the way it will always be. I am still learning Java, and I learned most of what I know from other GitHub users, as well as some online tutorials. If you spot somewhere I have made a mistake, or could do it better, let me know by either sending me a message or submitting a Pull Request.\r\n\r\n### CurseForge\r\nAll files for [Adventurer's Amulets](http://gustoniaeagle.github.io/Adventurers-Amulets/) will be hosted on CurseForge. A link to the site will be posted here as soon as I release the mod to the public.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any queries, e-mail me on gustoniaeagle@gmail.com, message me on Twitter or send me a message on GitHub. If you find a bug, submit it as an issue on [the repository](https://github.com/GustoniaEagle/Adventurer-s-Amulets) with full description and crash reports.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
